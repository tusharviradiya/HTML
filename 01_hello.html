Origins (1989-1990):

HTML was invented by Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist, in 1989.
The first version of HTML, HTML 1.0, was released in 1991 as a simple markup language with a small set of tags for structuring documents.
Growth and Standardization (1995-1997):

HTML 2.0 was released in 1995, adding new features such as forms and tables.
HTML 3.2, released in 1997, introduced support for more styling options and better browser compatibility.
During this period, browser wars between Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator led to some fragmentation in HTML implementation.
HTML4 and XHTML (1997-2000):

HTML 4.01, released in 1999, provided better support for multimedia and scripting.
XHTML (Extensible HTML) emerged as a reformulation of HTML4 in XML syntax, emphasizing stricter rules for markup.
HTML5 (2008-present):

HTML5, developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), aimed to modernize and extend HTML.
It introduced new semantic elements (e.g., <header>, <footer>) to improve document structure and accessibility.
HTML5 also brought native support for audio and video elements, canvas for drawing graphics, and APIs for offline web applications and geolocation.
HTML5 has been continually updated and expanded, with ongoing development to address new challenges and opportunities in web development.
